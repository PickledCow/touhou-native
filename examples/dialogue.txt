0|1|10|Well I made it to the summit like you told me to, but I can't see anything here.
1|1|10|This is the right place for sure. We're detecting massive distortions in time and space. 
1|1|10|Marisa, it seems that whatever is happening here is directly linked to the chaos going on back in Gensokyo. 
1|1|10|According to my research, this incredible energy is coming from Legendary beasts known as "Pokémon".
2|1|10|Be careful Marisa. These Pokémon... they're not like anything we've faced back at home but their power is immense. You'll need to be on guard.
0|1|10|Poké-what now? Sounds like just a fancy name for a bunch of youkai, but you say they're more than that huh?
4|1|5|
0|1|10|Whoa! Would ya look at those guys. These are the weirdest youkai I've ever seen. I see like a... giant dinosaur thing, a... [REDACTED], and a demonic snake thing?
0|1|10|Hey, Patchy, you got any notes on these three?
1|1|10|That 'dinosaur' is Dialga, Master of Time. It can control the very flow of time itself. 
1|1|10|The [REDACTED], as you've very colourfully described it, is Palkia, Ruler of Space. It can bend the fabric of space.
1|1|10|And that 'serpent' is Giratina, the Renegade Pokémon. It's from the Distortion World, a realm where the rules of our reality don't apply. 
1|1|10|Giratina's power is beyond anything we've ever encountered.
2|1|10|Marisa, Giratina seems to be the ringleader here. It's the one who's energy frequencies match the best with the chaos unfolding back here. 
2|1|10|It's somehow managed to manipulate Dialga and Palkia into joining its cause, whatever that might be. 
2|1|10|If you don't stop them Gensokyo is going to go bye bye, always on DRM.
0|1|10|Great, so I'm up against the literal gods of time and space along with some chaos demon snake and they're all out to destroying Gensokyo in the crossfire? 
0|1|10|For me? Just another Tuesday.
3|1|10|BISHAAN!
0|1|10|Yeah, yeah, "Bishaan" to you too bud. Now lets greet these big bad "Pokémon" Gensokyo Style!
